            Newkirk’s Full Circle
        </h1>
        <div class= "essay">
        <p>It’s 7AM on a Tuesday. It’s early in the morning, the sky still completely darkened. I pull the hood of my sweatshirt over my head as I walk on Foster Avenue, the wind chilling me to the bone. I turn right onto Newkirk Plaza, pass the Santander and American Bank, the cheap Asian fruit store, and Lo Duca Pizzeria that are lined across the border of the plaza, then turn left into the subway station that is at the center. After swiping my student metrocard at the turnstile, I walk down the steps to the Manhattan bound train platform. I’m waiting for the B. I go to my usual place and stare aimlessly at the tracks that are strewn with all sorts of junk: Arizona bottles, plastic bags, toilet paper, and socks. The pigeons coo their soft murmurs and the baby rats the size of a ping pong ball scurry after each other across the planks of wood on the tracks. Welcome to Newkirk Plaza.</p>

<p>I go to Newkirk Plaza almost every day, taking the B on weekdays and Q on weekends. Each morning I observe those who board the same train as me: the mother and her daughter, the tall teenage boy with curly hair, the middle aged Hisapnic man with his bike, the young, well-dressed lady who never wears a mask, and the old Russian woman who is always lost in her novel. These people are strangers, yet I feel as if I know them. 
The headlights of the B become visible, and the train soon rushes through the station, stirring up a strong breeze. I step onboard, assess my relatively crowded surroundings, and take a seat which is rarely available. I go past the regular stops and get off at Broadway Lafayette in Manhattan.</p>
	<p>It’s now 9PM on the same day. I’m on my way home from soccer practice, and I’m taking the B home. The train passes over the Manhattan Bridge, the buildings, cars, and street lights illuminating the island and the gloomy sky above it. It is almost empty inside with an ample amount of seating left. The train pulls into Newkirk Plaza at 9:25. Another person exits with me, and we walk up the stairs and head our separate ways. Lo Duca is still open with people socializing on the bench outside it, but the lights of the fruit store and banks are off. Another gale bursts through the plaza, and I start my speed walk to get home sooner.
<p>Early in the morning and late at night, I begin and end my days at Newkirk Plaza. Every time I walk through it or stand at the station I can’t help but detect the inundation of a certain feeling, this sensation, that relates to the repetitive, monotonous way of life New Yorkers have. We all go through our morning, daytime, and evening routines, which turn into our daily procedure, and eventually become our lives. In my lifestyle of school, soccer, and homework, I am in a mindset of constant labor. Despite the self-sufficient, almost ruthless, mindset of New Yorkers and the separation it can bring, all of us in some way have been caught in this mundane hamster wheel of life.</p> 
<p>New York is undoubtedly better than most places, but many misconceptions about it still persist. The city is romanticized into a false depiction of a quintessential metropolis, an urban haven where one exists in the ideal, aesthetic environment that fits their needs. This is represented through the media in short glimpses, snapshots of what is intended to be seen, but the truth of this city can only be found through experience. My experience of New York City, and that of many other New Yorkers, has practically been my whole life, and life mainly consists of our unvaried day-to-day practices. We all live our dull lives, with little, yet occasional, thrill or deviation from our norm, and our self-righteous, pretentious New Yorker attitude flies out the window forgotten. Life itself is boring, and it’s no different in New York than it is anywhere else.</p> 
	<p>Hopefully, I will bring the hamster wheel I tirelessly live on to a halt and step off it, extract some sort of meaning to walking it, and view my place in the universe with a more holistic perspective. But right now I turn off Newkirk Plaza back onto Foster Avenue into the dreary, shadowy streets, chattering my teeth and clenching my hands deep into my pockets, trying to make it home before 9:30.</p>
